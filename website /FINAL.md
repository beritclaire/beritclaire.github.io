#Introduction -

My website is simple and to the point when able to view the website ( I am currently knee deep in coding problems for some reason all the pretty attributes in Bootstrap are not showing on my github page :( ) I was interested by other artist websites and the creative template that I used for my webpage a clean attractive and modern website to display my art work which is the background for the website. Artists that particullary modivated me to make a portfolio web page was artist Mavis Smiths age http://www.mavissmithart.com/ who utilized her art work as her homepage. 
I used the Creative template on Bootstrap with the following meta data and footnotes:
   
   
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="author" content="">

    <title>Creative - Start Bootstrap Theme</title>

My site is a portfolio site which gives you a taste of my photography a medium I am leaning toward empahsizing in and need a lot of work in technique and studio practice but this website helped me figure out what images i liked the most. Unfortunatley all my psd files (photoshop) images that I love were not available due to not renewing the subscription and I would have renewed had I not had to buy premiere pro for sound design and 2 late fees from the library which are schockingly 20 dollars each. My audience is fellow artists and for gallery submissions, and freelance work. The website when in full view is seperating in blocks; 1 Intro : Name and profession with header navigation and background image. 2: brief bio with light blue background with a link to the portfolio that sits right below the bio but technology is cool so I still added a link. 3: 6 photographs in thumbnail form , when you scroll over says the title. there are 4 camera images and 2 photoshop projects. When you click the images they open to a new page to view the image larger. The gallery used to work but due to me messing around more I have lost the small gallery.  The fourth block is my contact information both email, and telephone. 

I had not as many problems making the website but translating it to github showed me I had a lot of problems. I lost track of time and didnt work on the home page as long as I wanted after I decided to switch to a template rather than coding myself on a quest for a "sexier" webpage. So I probably need to finish so it is an accesible website which it is not at the moment. My future work is to work on this webpage and better represent my art work by adding old paintings and adding photoshopped images that I forgot to export to JPEG. I would change my website by adding a more personable font, my sound design projects, and more artwork, a better gallery also which was my intention but it is lost in the code . I want to maintain my intro block one I love and keep the cool linked thumbnail images as well as my footer. I may have to look around at an easier template which tells you how to incoperate better. I think web design isnt my fortay but the effort I put in makes up for my epic failure attempting this class online over the summer. I think I lost my focus when we started using Java Script but I can still work on the project to better represent all the things I have learner in this course.
