		<h1>Love</h1>
        
		<p>TELL me where is Fancy bred,
        <br />
            Or in the heart or in the head?
            <br />
How begot, how nourished?<br />
Reply, reply.<br />
It is engender'd in the eyes,<br />
With gazing fed; and Fancy dies<br />
In the cradle where it lies.<br />
Let us all ring Fancy's knell:<br />
I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.<br />
All. Ding, dong, bell.<br />
            <br>
        <br /> William Shakespeare
