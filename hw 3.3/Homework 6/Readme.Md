# Homework 6 

For my website I want to showcase a portfolio of my favorite art pieces. I will seperate independant work and work that I created for courses I have completed thus far at The School of Fine Arts at University of Montana. In addition to my portfolio I will have a section of my visual projects with the school of Media Arts. I want a simple header and a short biography with images to different pages that are also links to another page with images.
